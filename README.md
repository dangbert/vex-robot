### PURPOSE:
To create a robot capable of completing multiple challenges so as to score as many points as possible in the UMBC UROS Spring 2016 competition.

### Features:
* Ability to press a button to programmatically reverse which side of the robot is the "front" and the "back" (so you don't have to drive "backwards")
* Both gross and fine control of the arm so as to quickly rotate to the perfect angle.
* Button that will automatically shake the arm and accurately drop its contents.

### DESIGN STRATEGY:
* We aimed to create a barebones simple robot that could deactivate the "bomb", rescue the lego people, and move the weights perfectly.
* The 4th challenge (moving all the ping pong balls) was prioritized last because each challenge was worth up to the same amount of points, and completing this challenge perfectly would have required spending a disproportionate amount of time on it and complicated the robot's design.

### RESULTS:
* The robot scored the maximum amount of points for 3 out of the 4 tasks in the competition, and it scored 15% of possible the points for the ping pong task.
* Scored 1st place out of 15+ teams.
* Also the cheapest robot in the class (~$75 of parts).
